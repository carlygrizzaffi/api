	<!-- Explain: APIs often come with different types of tools.
		It's very important to first understand an API before we start using it. -->

	<!-- Step 2: Include the open layers script! -->

	<!--- We want to create a button that will move us back ot our starting location (point) when we click it ---> <!--- See we create a button using hte button tag and then we use onclick (which executes an event when an element is clucked) In this case, the event would be the jav ascript function. Fun fact, onclick is a part of DOM Events, and is not a jaascript function (just to clarify;)--->
<!--- Step 4: We want to create a textbox and button for users to input the location we want to pan to -->
<textarea id = "country-name" rows = "1" cols = "20">Haiti</textarea>
<button onclick = "makeCountryRequest()">Pan to Country</button>
<button onclick = "panHome()">Home</button>
